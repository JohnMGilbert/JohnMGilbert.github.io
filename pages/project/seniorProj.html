            <h2>Perishable Food Reduction Application</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to develop the backend for an application that minimizes perishable food waste and cost while allowing for individual diet habits to be realistically maintained. Most food management applications don't consider food waste, and make the assumption that foods purchases will always be used. Instead, I aim to target a user space where people don't want to ahere to a food plan, and instead learn from a user's trends.</p>
            <h2>Cooperative Reward Sharing in Decentralized MDPs</h2>
            <p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are expensive, so monitoring the state of each perishable item takes a lot of time as a pantry grows in size. In my implementation, each item in the pantry is represented by its own MDP. At the reward step, it aggrigates the reward of all MDPs and then redistributes a modified reward back to the MDPs based on the shared outcome.</p>

            <p>The above graph shows how my method combined with MCTS can reduce food waste. I ran multiple simulations.<p>
            <p>Ultimately, this project is a proof of concept for my MDP rewards sharing. I'm currently working on other implementations of this method.</p>
