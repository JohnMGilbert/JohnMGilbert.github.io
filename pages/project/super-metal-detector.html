            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>One of my oldests friends and I have always wanted to make a game together. He's a graphic designer and all around talented artist. I'm trying to be a decent game developer. He lives across the country now but we still try to find time to work on this game when we get a chance.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>Super Metal Detector is an exploration and rhythm game where you take on the role of a simple guy who likes to hunt for metallic objects on the beach. Meet the other beach bums, help 'em out if you can, and explore the depths of the beach caverns (yeah, there's caves under all that sand), and upgrade your metal detecting abilities.</p>

            <h2>Preview</h2>
            <p>To be real, we aren't far enough to demo something crazy interesting, but here's some of what we have so far. It's not much, but hey, it's something. Come back to check out our progress!</p>
