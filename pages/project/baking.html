            <h2>Don't Buy Bread!</h2>
            <p>Ok, maybe most people don't want to make their own sourdough bread. I get it. It takes 2 days, requires frequent attention, and you need to feed you starter like it's a goldfish.</p>
            <p>But, you will never tast better bread then a fresh loaf you bake yourself.</p>
            <img src="/personal-website/assets/images/loaf.png" class="bread-images">
            <p>Here's the recipe for the above loaf of bread:</p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mix Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine 450g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 350g of water. Mix until just combined. Cover and let rest for 1 hour (autolyse).</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Starter and Salt:</strong> Add 90g ripe sourdough starter and 10g salt to the dough. Mix thoroughly until fully incorporated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bulk Fermentation:</strong> Cover the dough and let it ferment at room temperature. Perform 3 sets of stretch and folds during the first 1.5 hours, spaced 30 minutes apart. Let the dough rise until it has increased in volume by about 20-30% and shows bubbles on the surface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Gently turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Pre-shape into a loose round and let it rest for 20-30 minutes. Then, shape it into a tight round or oval, depending on your proofing basket.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof:</strong> Place the shaped dough seam-side up in a floured proofing basket. Cover and let it proof at room temperature for 1-2 hours, or retard in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) with a Dutch oven inside. Carefully turn the dough onto parchment paper, score the top, and transfer it into the preheated Dutch oven. Cover with the lid and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes until the crust is deep golden brown.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cool:</strong> Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
                </ol>
