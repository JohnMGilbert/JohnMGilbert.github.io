            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                The Asset and Animation Manager is a custom tool built in the Godot engine designed to simplify the process of importing, organizing, and animating assets. 
                Its primary goal is to give artists and non-programmers more control over how their assets appear and behave in-game, without needing to navigate Godot’s complex interface or rely on code. 
                By bridging the gap between artist and programmer, the application promotes a smoother, more collaborative workflow.

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                Many artists struggle to translate their creative intentions into functioning game assets because existing animation tools either require programming knowledge 
                or focus too heavily on image editing rather than animation management. 
                This project addresses those issues by offering an intuitive workspace where users can drag and drop assets, organize them visually, and export complete animation data packages directly into Godot projects.

            <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The application is developed entirely within the Godot engine, ensuring compatibility with existing Godot projects. 
                It supports PNG, MP4, and WAV formats and is designed to remain lightweight and responsive even when managing hundreds of assets. 
                By abstracting complex animation logic into a visual editor, it allows artists to focus on creativity while maintaining technical accuracy.

            <h2>Intended Use</h2>
            <p>
                The Asset and Animation Manager is meant for small, independent development teams and individual artists working on 2D games. 
                It can be used during the asset creation phase to prepare fully configured animations before importing them into a game project, 
                allowing programmers and artists to collaborate efficiently without technical bottlenecks.
