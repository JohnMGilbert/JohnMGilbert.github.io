            <p>Hello!
            </p>
            <p>I'm John, a full-stack software developer and Masters student and New Mexico State University persuing my
                degree in computer science.</p>
            <p>Before I became a graduate student, I was a baker and part-time general contractor (handyman).
                When a buddy of mine suggested we work on a small indie game together, I thought I'd give programming a
                shot.
                I quickly found a new passion in software development. Looking to get out of the more back-breaking
                work, I decided to
                return to school. During my degree, I've focused on Artificial Intellegence and game design. These two
                topics of study have been complementary with each other. I've learned that if I can have
                some form of creative expression in my work, I'm happy.
